# What is this?

This is a simple crawler to parse and display all the email addresses of the Polytechnique Montreal university employee "phonebook".

Does not throttle requests so is a bit spammy!

# How to use it?

Tested with python 3.8 (probably works with 3.9 too!)

- Install the requirements (requests + beautifulsoup4)
- Run the python code : 
```
python3 poly-crawler.py
```
